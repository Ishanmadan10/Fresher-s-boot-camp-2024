User story: As a user, I want the form validation to happen in real time so that I can correct any errors as I fill out the form.

Requirements:

Functional requirements

1. Real time validation- as soon as the end user inputs the data should be validated.
1. Field specific validation- different fields will be added with different kind of data e.g. Number, email etc. so the system should validate each of them differently.
1. Immediate error feedback- error messages should be immediate to facilitate real time changes. 

Non functional requirements

1. Performance – solution shouldn’t cause performance degradation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
1. Scalability- solution should allow large number of validations getting performed simultaneously without any errors. 
1. Compatibility- solution should be compatible with different browsers.
1. Security- user input should be protected and not be leaked.
1. Usability- error messages should be user friendly and easily understandable.
